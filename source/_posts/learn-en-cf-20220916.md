When I first went to Hong Kong a number of years ago，I had no idea about the Chinese language or the Chinese culture.Shortly after my arrival，I went to the bank on my way to school.I was extremely surprised when the bank clerk asked me if I had had my lunch.In British culture，this question would be regarded as an indirect invitation to lunch，and between unmarried young people it indicates a young man’s interest in dating a girl. Since he was a complete stranger，I was quite taken aback.1 proceeded to school and was even more surprised when one of the teachers asked me the same question.By now I realized that it could not be an invitation ，but I was puzzled as to why they kept asking it.In the following days， as I was asked the question again and again，I came to the conclusion that people must be concerned about my health.I was somewhat underweight，and I assumed they must be worried that I was not eating properly.Only later， did I find out that the question had no real significance at all，it was merely a greeting.

English people have a very strong sense of privacy.They are easily offended by comments which seem to invade their personal lives，so the Chinese greeting“Where are you going?”is uncomfortable to them.They regard it as a request for information and as an invasion of their privacy.In fact，many foreign teachers in China have complained that their room attendants are spies because the attendants have greeted them with“Where are you going? ”


`翻译;`

几年前我第一次去香港的时候，我对中国语言和中国文化一无所知。到达后不久，我在上学的路上去了银行。当银行职员问我是否吃过午饭时，我非常惊讶。在英国文化中，这个问题会被视为是对午餐的间接邀请，在未婚年轻人之间，它表明年轻人对约会女孩的兴趣。由于他是一个完全陌生的人，我大吃一惊。我继续上学，当一位老师问我同样的问题时，我更加惊讶。现在我意识到这不可能是一个邀请，但我不明白为什么他们一直问我。在接下来的几天里，当我一次又一次被问到这个问题时，我得出结论，人们必须关心我的健康。我有点体重不足，我想他们一定担心我吃得不好。直到后来，我才发现这个问题根本没有真正的意义，只是一个问候而已。
英国人有很强的隐私意识。他们很容易被那些似乎侵犯了他们个人生活的评论所冒犯，所以中国人的问候语“你要去哪里？”对他们来说是不舒服的。他们认为这是对信息的请求，是对他们隐私的侵犯。事实上，许多在中国的外籍教师抱怨说，他们的客房服务员是间谍，因为服务员用“你要去哪里？”
